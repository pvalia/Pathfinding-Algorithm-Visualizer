# Path finding Visualizer

This Pathfinder Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application designed to demonstrate the workings of two fundamental pathfinding algorithms: Dijkstra's Algorithm and the A* (A-Star) Algorithm. By visually displaying the process of searching for the shortest route from a starting node to a finishing node, this tool aids in understanding these complex algorithms' efficiency and behavior in various scenarios.

You can test the web app here: https://pvalia.github.io/Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualizer/

## Using the Visualizer

1. **Set Start and Finish**: Click on the grid to place the starting and finishing nodes.
2. **Draw Walls**: Drag across the grid to create walls that the algorithm must navigate around.
3. **Select Algorithm**: Choose between Dijkstra's and A* algorithms from the dropdown menu.
4. **Visualize Path**: Click the "Visualize" button to start the pathfinding visualization.
5. **Reset Grid**: Clear the grid to start a new visualization.

# Demo

You can choose between 2 algorithms, add walls, and clear the grid. Below are examples of the algorithms in action:
